# Robotics AI / ML Engineering Roadmap

This repository tries to document my journey to becoming a proficient Robotics AI / ML Engineer & landing my first job in the field.

I currently have a background in physics and data science, with the following qualifications:
- **M.Sc. in Physics & ML**
- **B.Sc. in Physics**
- **B.Sc. thesis** on *Deep Reinforcement Learning*
- **M.Sc. thesis** on *High-Dimensional Data Analysis*, where I developed a novel algorithm for **Reservoir Computing** & Causal Inference.

This repository should simultanously serve both as:
- a **learning log**, and  
- a **portfolio**

While I personally don't believe that LLMs will replace human engineers, I do plan to use them in this repository to e.g. coalesce my notes into a presentable markdown file.
